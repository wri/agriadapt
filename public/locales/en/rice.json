Continuous groundwater extraction for rice paddy irrigation is already resulting in a steep decline in groundwater availability."

The Universal Thermal Climate Index identifies outdoor conditions that cause discomfort to people using a combination of temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation to determine the stress (sweating, shivering, skin wetness, etc.) a person undergoes when exposed to outdoor conditions.", 
        "Values between 9-26 means no thermal stress. Values above 26 are approaching heat stress, with values above 46 meaning extreme heat stress. Values below 9 are approaching cold stress, with values below -40 meaning extreme cold stress."

      "info": "The vast majority of climate change impacts on rice production result from variations in temperature and rainfall that lead to flooding, water scarcity, and increases in pests, diseases, and weeds. Although predictions of future climate conditions include an amount of uncertainty, it is important to measure the potential effects of climate change on global rice production. These insights can identify areas that are vulnerable to climate change and inform the development of adaptation strategies. Considering changes in rice yields is also valuable for ensuring future food security under the pressures of an increasing population and a growing rice demand."
