      "Temperature increases, rising sea levels, and changes in rainfall patterns and distribution could lead to substantial impacts on land and water resources for rice production. Continuous groundwater extraction for rice paddy irrigation is already resulting in a steep decline in groundwater across India (Oo 2018)."

      "info": "Agricultural workers are especially vulnerable to increased heat stress, which affects the health of individuals and reduces labour productivity. The Universal Thermal Climate Index identifies outdoor conditions that cause discomfort to people using a combination of temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation to determine the stress (sweating, shivering, skin wetness, etc.) a person undergoes when exposed to outdoor conditions."

      "info": "The vast majority of climate change impacts on rice production result from variations in temperature and rainfall that lead to flooding, water scarcity, and increases in pests, diseases, and weeds. Despite significant uncertainty in predicted future climate conditions, it is important to measure the potential effects of climate change on global rice production as these insights can identify areas that are vulnerable to climate change and inform the development of adaptation strategies. Considering changes in rice yields is also valuable for ensuring future food security under the pressures of an increasing population and a growing rice demand."

The Food score incorporates six indicators (projected change of cereal yields, projected population growth, food import dependency, rural population, agricultural capacity, and child malnutrition) to capture its vulnerability with regard to food production and demand, nutrition, and rural population."

With this new climate risk data, we hope to influence decision makers and adjust the policies on subsidies to support small scale workers in a shifting climate."
