    "description": [
      "The cotton value chain is likely to experience disruptions due to climate change impacts such as water availability, changing rainfall patterns, and rising temperatures. Cotton's lengthy growing season (approximately 150-180 days) already makes the crop quite vulnerable to pests and diseases. A warmer climate will only increase cotton's susceptibility."

        "Agricultural workers are especially vulnerable to increased heat stress, which affects the health of individuals and reduces labor productivity. The Universal Thermal Climate Index identifies outdoor conditions that cause discomfort to people using a combination of temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation to determine the stress (sweating, shivering, skin wetness, etc.) a person undergoes when exposed to outdoor conditions.", 
        "Values between 9-26 means no thermal stress. Values above 26 are approaching heat stress, with values above 46 meaning extreme heat stress. Values below 9 are approaching cold stress, with values below -40 meaning extreme cold stress."

The incidence of pests and diseases are climate related and the AgriAdapt can help us in providing early warning systems with its data on climate variability and forecasted risks"

Through a robust platform like AgriAdapt, Ginners/Spinners can identify the least affected regions to climate hazards and plan their purchases of cotton accordingly from these cultivated areas."

      "quote": "Extreme weather events are affecting the quality of cotton. We have been facing a lot of problems related to the poor quality of cotton while procurement, which affects the final output and poses serious threats to the business. By knowing the climatic hazards and unseasonal rain through the AgriAdapt, we can procure cotton well in advance to avoid the purchase of cotton at a high cost and of poor quality. We can also sensitize our suppliers/farmers about climate hazards and possible infestation of pests and disease so that we can avoid climate related risks at the source itself."
