    <h1><strong>Reefs are Threatened</strong></h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Coral reefs face a wide and intensifying array of threats—from both local and global sources.</strong>
      <span> The local threats include impacts from overfishing and destructive fishing (with explosives or poisons), coastal development, sewage discharge, poorly managed tourism, plastic and other pollution, agricultural runoff, and shipping (a source of invasive species, pollution, and physical damage). The global threats of warming and acidifying seas are driven by greenhouse gas emissions, and the dissolving of CO</span>

      waters.
      <strong>This combination of threats has already resulted in the </strong>
      <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/reefs-risk-revisited" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>degradation and, in some cases, loss of more than half of the world’s coral reefs</strong></a>
      <strong>.</strong>
      <span> Degradation is typified by reduced areas of living coral, increased algal cover, coral disease, reduced species diversity, and lower fish abundance. These changes will reduce the value of coral reefs for fisheries, tourism, shoreline protection, and other values, impacting dependent coastal communities.</span>

The use of destructive techniques (explosives and poisons) and reef gleaning (gathering and collecting seafood at low tide) can also directly damage coral reefs.&nbsp;</span>
        Heavily fished reefs are prone to algal overgrowth, without herbivorous fish to graze the algae as it grows.

            <span>Development of human settlements, industry, aquaculture, and infrastructure in the coastal zone can impact coral reefs—either directly through physical damage from dredging or land filling, or indirectly through increased runoff of sediment and pollution. Elevated nutrient levels in sewage encourage blooms of plankton that block light and encourage growth of seaweeds that compete for space on the reef, while the bacteria promote coral disease. </span>

      <h2>Watershed-based Pollution</h2>

        <strong>Pollution from inland activities includes erosion due to land clearing, sewage from tourists and residents, and runoff of livestock waste, fertilizers, and pesticides from agricultural lands.</strong>

        {' '}
        <span>coastal waters and coral reefs—sometimes extending more than 100km from river mouths. In high quantities, sediments can smother, weaken, and kill corals, while in lower quantities, they reduce sunlight reaching corals, slowing coral growth.&nbsp;Excessive levels of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in shallow coastal waters can encourage blooms of phytoplankton, which reduce light reaching the corals, can cause growth of algae and seaweeds which can overgrow corals. Mangroves and seagrass habitats can help trap sediments and remove nutrients.</span>
