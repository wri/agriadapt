        <p>Coral reefs provide vitally important goods and services in countries around the globe but are besieged by an array of threats. For coral reefs to survive in the coming decades we need to:</p>
        <ol className="number-list">
          <li>
            <strong>reduce local threats to coral reefs</strong>
            {' '}
            â€“ manage fisheries sustainably, eliminate destructive fishing, lessen pollution entering the ocean, manage costal development sustainably
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>decrease emissions of greenhouse gases</strong>
            {' '}
            in order to try to keep warming to the 1.5 degree C target, thereby lessening the risk of coral bleaching and acidification
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>increase investment in coastal management and restoration</strong>
            , with emphasis on resilience-based management and the use of data and information to understand and reduce risk
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>establish and effectively manage marine protected areas </strong>
            and other effective area-based conservation measures
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ensure that management decisions are inclusive and participatory</strong>
            , based on data, and examine equity implications
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>manage tourism sustainably </strong>
            to lessen impacts and benefit local communities&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>raise awareness of the value of coral reefs</strong>
            {' '}
            and other coastal ecosystems, including the cost of degradation and loss
