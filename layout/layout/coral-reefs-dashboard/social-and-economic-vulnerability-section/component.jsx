    <p>
      <strong>Degradation and loss of reefs cause significant social and economic impacts, and these impacts vary widely based on local circumstances.</strong>
      <span> A countryâ€™s vulnerability to reef loss is influenced by its level of dependence on coral reefs for food, livelihoods, exports, tourism revenue, and shoreline protection, as well as the adaptive capacity of the population (ability to cope with the effects of degradation). Adaptive capacity is influenced by social and economic factors including education, health, governance, access to markets, and availability of economic and agricultural resources.</span>
