            "description": "### Overview  \n  \nThe Solar Energy Potential dataset is made up of two layers: average daily global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and average daily photovoltaic power potential. GHI is the sum of direct and diffuse radiation received on a horizontal plane presented in the units kilowatt hour per square meter (kWh/m²). Radiation is energy that moves from one place to another and in this dataset it refers to energy released by the sun traveling to Earth. Irradiance refers to the average amount of radiation received in a given area on Earth.  Photovoltaic power potential, or Potential photovoltaic electricity\nProduction (PVOUT), is the estimated amount of energy converted by a photovoltaic system into electricity presented in kilowatt-hour per kilowatt peak of the photovoltaic system (kWh/kWp) according to the geographical conditions of a site and configuration of the photovoltaic system. GHI acts as an important base measurement to help determine regions that receive enough sunlight and is used to assess an area for flat-plate photovoltaic and solar heating technologies. PVOUT works to calculate the actual effectiveness of a solar energy project in the region based on local conditions.\n\n  \n  \nThe datasets were created using geostationary satellite imagery and meteorological models, including SolarGIS’s global solar model (v2.1). Satellite imagery data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), North American Space Agency (NASA), European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMESTAT), and Japan Meteorological Administration (JMA).\n\n  \n  \nThe final averages presented in these datasets were created using yearly and daily averages taken between 1994/1999/2007 and 2018, depending on region of the world. The GHI dataset is presented on Resource Watch at a spatial resolution of 250 meters and PVOUT 1 kilometer. \n\n  \n  \nThese datasets are taken from SolarGIS’s Global Solar Atlas, which is funded by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). The Global Solar Atlas was created to help companies and governments improve the efficiency of photovoltaic projects. Increasing sustainable energy production, like solar, is a crucial step in reducing the world’s reliance on fossil fuels.\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nThe average daily global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and average daily photovoltaic power potential layers were created using SolarGIS’s global solar model (v2.1). The model utilizes data from geostationary satellites and metrological models. First, clear-sky irradiance values were calculated using the position of the sun on earth at a given time. The irradiance values used in the calculations assumed that there were no clouds present in the sky. This determined the sun’s irradiance that reached earth based on the effect of altitude, concentration of aerosols (particles coming from different sources, natural and human), water vapor, and ozone. Then data from geostationary meteorological satellites was input to determine cloud cover during the same time period. These two data sources were coupled to provide the global horizontal irradiation values.\n\n  \n  \nThe photovoltaic power potential was calculated by combining the horizontal irradiation dataset with data on surface air temperature and a simulation of photovoltaic power cells. First, the horizontal irradiation dataset was converted into irradiation at optimum tilt to provide ideal conditions for power potential on a photovoltaic cell. Optimum tilt refers to the most efficient angle for a surface to be at to receive the highest amount of the sun’s radiation. Surface air temperature data was collected from meteorological stations when available and otherwise from meteorological models. Data from models was disaggregated by SolarGIS to increase their spatial resolution. The photovoltaic power cell simulation used was the Single-diode equivalent circuit simulation.\n\n\n  \n  \nTo create a daily average value of GHI and PVOUT, data was averaged between 1994 and 2018 for Europe/Africa, 1999 and 2018 for North America/South America/Central Asia, and 2007 and 2018 for East Asia. GHI data was presented in kWh/m² at a spatial resolution of 9 arcsec (250 m). PVOUT data was in kWh/kWp with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec (1 km).\n\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please click on the “Learn more” button.\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. Additional data for diffuse horizontal irradiation, direct normal irradiation, terrain elevation above sea level, global irradiation for optimally tilted surfaces, optimum tilt to maximize yearly yield, and air temperature at 2 m above ground level is available from the data provider.

It is possible that regions with lower quantities of data available have slightly less accurate averages.\n",

            "description": "### Overview  \n  \nThe Alert for Price Spikes (ALPS) dataset tracks the current prices of key staple food commodities and compares them to expected prices, which are calculated based on seasonal trends. An ALPS value is assigned to a given commodity at a particular market based on how much its current price differs from the expected price. This value is used to categorize a commodity’s price into one of four categories: normal, stress, alert, or crisis.\r\n  \n  \n\r\nFood prices on a local market often correlated with food security crises. Food price spikes can have devastating impacts for rural households in developing countries since they spend a large percentage of income on food. ALPS serves three main purposes for decision-making. First, it can serve as a price monitoring tool that allows users to identify price abnormalities. Second, ALPS can generate early warning information that enables users to prepare and act to reduce harm to households most vulnerable to food price fluctuations. Third, ALPS can trigger contingency planning by anticipating food price crises. \r\n  \n  \n\r\nThe ALPS dataset is generated by the World Food Programme (WFP) and monitors markets spanning more than 60 countries. The time period over which prices have been tracked varies by location, but certain markets have food price data as early as 1994. The data is updated monthly for markets that are actively being monitored.  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nSeasonal price trends were determined through reference to monthly commodity prices recorded in the WFP's Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) Food and Commodity Price dataset. This dataset was collected by WFP country offices, national government agencies, and partner organizations. \r\n  \n  \n\r\nThe ALPS indicator level was calculated in four steps:\r\n- **Estimation of seasonal price trends**: The seasonal price trend was calculated using a linear regression of market price data over the entire period for which data was available. Both the long-term trend and monthly fluctuations, related to the production or demand of a commodity, were included in the regression.\r\n  \n  \n- **Calculation of the difference between market price and estimated price**: The difference between the observed price and the expected price based on seasonal trends was calculated for each month.\r\n  \n  \n- **Calculation of the ALPS indicator considering price volatility**: Each month’s difference was divided by the standard deviation of the differences over all of the recorded months, producing the value of the ALPS indicator.\r\n  \n  \n- **Categorization of the ALPS indicator**: Based on the ALPS indicator value, markets were assigned to one of four situations:  (1) Normal: ALPS < 0.25; (2) Stress: 0.25 ≤ ALPS < 1; (3) Alert: 1 ≤ ALPS < 2; (4) Crisis: ALPS ≥ 2.\r\n  \n  \n\r\nFor the full documentation, please click on the “Learn more” button.\r\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

It does not account explicitly for other factors in the general economy, such as general price inflation rates, that may impact how seriously fluctuations in key staple food prices affect local buying power and food security. The linear regression used to calculate the seasonal trends and variability in prices assumes that the time series of prices is stationary for each market, i.e., that the nature of the trend doesn't vary over time for each market. The general economic forces affecting prices, such as population growth and inflation, are implicitly represented by the coefficient of the trend term in the linear regression. Under the assumption of stationarity, these forces are assumed to be constant for each market, but this may not be realistic. \n  \n  \n- When using and interpreting ALPS dataset in the context of market and food security analysis, it is important to note that the indicator is more meaningful when used for the most consumed food commodities in the country. Locally produced staples food commodities should also get priority attention, and finally analysts can also consider imported commodities. \n",
